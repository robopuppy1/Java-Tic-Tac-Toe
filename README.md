# Troubleshooting

Q. My move isn't registering. What do I do?
Re-enter the move a couple of times. If it doesn't work after 5 tries, try choosing a different move or resetting the game.

Q. How is the score kept?
If the player gets three in a row in any direction, they get a point. There aren't any penalties for losing the round.
